# Peer-to-Peer Chat System

## Overview
This is a simple Peer-to-Peer (P2P) chat system that allows multiple users to connect and exchange messages over a network. Each peer acts as both a client and a server, enabling direct communication without a central server.

## Features
- Start a peer server to accept connections
- Send messages to other peers using their IP and port
- Handle multiple connections using threading
- Display a list of currently connected peers
- Simple text-based menu for easy interaction

## How It Works
1. Each peer runs the script and provides their name and port number.
2. The peer starts listening for incoming connections.
3. Users can send messages to other peers by entering their IP and port.
4. Messages are exchanged in real time, and peers can disconnect by sending an `exit` message.

## Installation
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x

### Steps to Run
1. Clone this repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/peer-to-peer-chat.git
   cd peer-to-peer-chat
   ```
2. Run the script:
   ```sh
   python peer_chat.py
   ```
3. Enter your name and the port number to start the peer.
4. Use the menu options to send messages or check connected peers.

## Usage
### Commands
- `1` â†’ Send a message
- `2` â†’ Query connected peers
- `0` â†’ Exit the chat
